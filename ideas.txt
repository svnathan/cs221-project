 NEW IDEAS
 ----------------------------------------------
1) trip planner - given a starting location and time duration recommend a itenerary of attractions to visit and places to eat using a constrained search algorithm basing costs and constraints on distance between locations/travel time, reviews of places, hours of operation, etc...
2) tourist meal planner - use yelp dataset; given city(location) and home base(hotel lat/long?), time start, time end, and cuisine preferences/restrictions recommend iternerary of places to eat during your trip using a constrained search algorithm basing costs and constraints on distance between locations/travel time, reviews of places, restaurant category, hours of operation, etc...
3) write the most useful review, make the most money - Epinions (Users can register for free and start writing subjective reviews about many different types of items (software, music, television show, hardware, office appliances, ...). A peculiar characteristics of Epinions is that users are paid according to how much a review is found useful), train on set of reviews looking at the item, the text and the usefulness and trustworthiness ratings, output reviews for items that would recieve higher usefulness and trustworthiness ratings
4)Stackexchange 1 - Find the people who are likely to answer a question. We can use some feature fitting along with information about the social network and using similar posts he has answered in the past (using tags). We can verify be including the right people who has answered the question along with a 100 random people, and our algo would guess who had answered the question.
5)Stackexchange 2 - Similar to previous suggestion. But here we guess the post a person is likely to answer.
